# Travel safe-Vaccination map
The aim of my project is to show the user what vaccines are recommended to take before going
to a specific country. It uses the google map to show where this country is.
#UX
The goal of the project is to be informative and easy to read.
Different colors are used to illustrate the four groups of vaccines. From green to red the colors illustrate
the transition from smaller amount of vaccines to bigger amount.
#Features
*First feature is the user insput to select a country.
*Second feature is zooming in the selected country on the map (in the process)
*Third feature is displaying the vaccination list needed before going to that country (in the process)
