## Testing

1.All HTML and CSS code used on the site has been tested using
[The W3 CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and
[The W3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
The W3C shows that we meet the standards of HTML and CSS. 

2.Prototype code was written and tested using Gitpod and Chrome Developer Tools.

3.All Javascript and jQuery code on the website has been tested using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).
Thanks to that app I found out how to split strings into shorter lines by using '\'. Also it says there is one unused
variable (on the js file row 230 initMap) and one undefined variable (231	google
237	google
238	google
240	google
241	google
243	google
264	google
265	google
266	google
267	google), but these are not causing any errors so they were left like this.

4.Site was viewed and tested in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.

----
## Deployment
 
The hosting platform for this site is GitHub. Here is the link for my site https://martakortslaur.github.io/TravelsafeVaccinationmap/. It is still under that
webpage name, but I changed it to Travel Safe Malaria Map, because there wasn't available json or other format files for the four groups of vaccines
and I chose something that is available in a pdf form and typed the data to my code myself.
